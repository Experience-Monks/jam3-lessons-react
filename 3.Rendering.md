# Rendering an Element into the DOM

In order to mount a element to DOM, firstly we need a empty tag in the HTML file:

```HTML
<div id="root"></div>
```

Everything inside this element will be managed by React DOM.
Now we call `ReactDOM.render()` to render the element by passing in the element and the root node in the DOM:

```JSX
const element = <h1>Hola Mundo</h1>
ReactDOM.render( element, document.getElementById('root') );
```

### React Only Updates What's Necessary 

React compares the DOM with the updated elements and only applies the DOM updates with the necessary changes. This is what makes React really fast.
