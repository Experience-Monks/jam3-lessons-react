#Components

Components allows you to split UI into small independent pieces.

##Functional Components
This is simplest way of defining Components.
Adele function just return a component, which has one line of div.

```
function Adele(){
  return <div>Hello It's me</div>;
}
```


##Pure(Stateless) Functional Components
This type of components has no state, and just shows received props. Therefore, it allows a developer to have loosely coupled component, which is more reusable and unit testing friendly.

```
const ReactLesson = (props) => {
  return (
    <div>{props.text}</div>
  )
};
```

##Class Components
This components basically perform same job as above components. However, it has more controls and features such as state and life cycle.
We will discuss more about state and react life cycle functions in other lessons.

```
class ReactLesson extends React.Components{
  render(){
    return (
      <div>Hello World!</div>
    )
  }
}
```
