**Jam3 Lessons - React**

# Components

Components allows you to split UI into small independent pieces.

## Functional Components

This is simplest way of defining Components.
Adele function just return a component, which has one line of div.

```javascript
function Adele() {
  return <div>Hello It is me</div>;
}
```


##Pure(Stateless) Functional Components
This type of components has no state, and just shows received props. Therefore, it allows a developer to have loosely coupled component, which is more reusable and unit testing friendly.

```javascript
const ReactLesson = (props) => {
  return (
    <div>{props.text}</div>
  )
};
```

## Class Components

This components basically perform same job as above components. However, it has more controls and features such as state and life cycle. We will discuss more about state and react life cycle functions in other lessons.

```javascript
class ReactLesson extends React.Components {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>Hello World!</div>
    );
  }
}
```
