# createElement

React provides us with a method to create elements that will compose our _components_.

```js
let helloWorld = React.createElement(
  'div',
  { id: 'hello' },
  'Hello World'
);
```

`React.createElement` takes the first argument as the tag of the node or a component defined by the developer, second the attributes and _props_ and finally a child or an array of them.

Since we are defining this elements in JavaScript we need to use `className` and `htmlFor` instead of `class` and `htmlFor` respectively since they are reserved words of the language
