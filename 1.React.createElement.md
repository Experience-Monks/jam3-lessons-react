# React.createElement

Components are composed by _elements_, other components or a combination of both.

Elements we create will be reflected as nodes in our web app and we do it by calling `React.createElement` like this:

```js
import React from 'react';

React.createElement(
  'div',
  { className: 'wrapper' },
  [ React.createElement('p', null, 'Lorem ipsum') ]
);
```

Notice the first argument of this method is the HTML tag name of the element, the second one an object containing attributes and _props_ and the third one a child element or an array of them. The output of the sample code from above should look like this.

```html
<div class="wrapper">
  <p>Lorem Ipsum</p>
</div>
```

Since `class` and `for` are reserved words in JavaScript `className` and `htmlFor` are used respectively to avoid parsing errors.
