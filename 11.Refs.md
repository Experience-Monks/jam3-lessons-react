# Refs

So far, the only way that parent components can trigger change within their child components is to pass new props and re-render.

Another way to communicate with child components is through refs. Through the ref attribute, the parent component can gain access to the child component.

There are two ways to use refs:

1. As an attribute to an HTML element. Its callback argument would be the underlying DOM element. The below would assign the value of the input tag to a variable called 'this.textInput'.

``` jsx
<input type="text" ref={(input) => { this.textInput = input; }} />
```

2. As an attribute to a custom component. Its callback argument would be the mounted instance of the component. The below would assign whatever is returned by CustomComponent to a variable called 'this.textInput'.

```jsx
<CustomComponent ref={(input) => { this.textInput = input; }} />
```

As a rule of thumb, try to use props before trying to use refs, so as to make it clear where to "own" the state of components (instead of passing values from one component to the other).
