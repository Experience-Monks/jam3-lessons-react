**Jam3 Lessons - React**

# JSX

First of all, JSX is **neither** a string **nor** HTML.

> Fundamentally, JSX just provides syntactic sugar for the `React.createElement(component, props, ...children)` function.

```JSX
<Welcome size="huge">
  Hey, you!
</Welcome>
```

compiles into

```JSX
React.createElement(
  Welcome,
  { size: 'huge' },
  'Hey, you!'
);
```

### Use Capitalized names for user-defined components

`React` thinks elements starting with a lowercase letter are native HTML elements. And elements starting with a capital letter are considered and corresponded to the components the user defined.
This is how `React` distinguishes a built-in element and a user-defined component.
