# JSX

First of all, JSX is **neither** a string **nor** HTML.

> Fundamentally, JSX just provides syntactic sugar for the `React.createElement(component, props, ...children)` function.

```JSX
<Welcome size="huge">
  Hey, you!
</Welcome>
```

compiles into

```JSX
React.createElement(
  Welcome,
  { size: 'huge' },
  'Hey, you!'
);
```

### Use capitalized names for user-defined components

`React` thinks elements starting with a lowercase letter are native HTML elements and elements starting with a capital letter are considered and corresponded to the components you defined or imported.
This is how `React` distinguishes a built-in element and a user-defined component.

### Expression interpolation

You can embed any JavaScript expression in JSX by wrapping it in curly braces:

```JSX
const sizes = ['small', 'medium', 'large', 'huge'];
const langs = ['Hello', 'Hola'];

<Welcome size={ sizes[3] }>
  { langs[0] }, you!
</Welcome>
```

Please note that:

- You may also use curly braces to embed a JavaScript expression in an attribute

- JSX is an expression too

- Adjacent JSX elements must be wrapped in an enclosing tag
