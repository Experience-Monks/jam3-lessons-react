# Lifecycle callbacks

For class based components, we have a set of methods available to call during its mounting, unmounting and update cycles.

This is what gets called when a component gets rendered for the first time:

- `constructor()`
- `componentWillMount()`
- `render()`
- `componentDidMount()`

When its state changes or a new prop is passed:

- `componentWillReceiveProps()`
- `shouldComponentUpdate()`
- `componentWillUpdate()`
- `render()`
- `componentDidUpdate()`

Finally, before the component gets remove from the DOM `componentWillUnmount()` is called.
