**Jam3 Lessons - React**

# Components

Components allows you to split UI into small independent and reusable pieces.

## Functional Components

This is simplest way of defining Components. `Lesson` is function that always returns an `<div>` tag with a text node as its children.

```jsx
function Lesson() {
  return <div>This is a lesson!</div>;
}
```


## Pure (Stateless) Functional Components

This type of components has no _state_, and just shows received _props_. Therefore, it allows a developer to have loosely coupled component, which is more reusable and unit testing friendly.

```jsx
const Lesson = (props) => {
  return (
    <div>{ props.text }</div>
  );
};
```


## Class Components

You can also create a new component by extending the `React.Component` class which comes with useful methods to grasp more control while the component is _alive_.

```jsx
class Lesson extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>{ this.props.text }</div>
    );
  }
}
```

Not mandatory, but it's recommended for class based components to call `super` passing down the received props.
