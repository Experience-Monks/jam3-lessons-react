# Routing



# General Concepts and Introduction

'react-router' is an npm module. It keeps the UI in sync with the URL. In the below example, going to '/' will load App. Going to '/home' will load App and Home.

```js
import { Router, Route } from 'react-router';
```
```jsx
<Router>
  <Route path="/" component={App}>
  	<Route path="home" component={Home} />
  </Route>
</Router>
```



# Creating Routes and this.props.children

'react-router' makes it possible to access child components from parent components through a prop. In the above example, the App component will have the Home component passed to it as a prop. App can access Home through a variable called 'this.props.children'. In this way, the App component can now return any of its child components depending on the user's location.



# Link Element

```js
import { Link } from 'react-router';
```
```jsx
<Link to="/home">Home</Link>
```

The Link tag is used to navigate through the application instead of using hardcode. A Link is considered active when a user is in its route, or any of its children's routes. Here is a list of the Link tag's attributes:

 --> activeClassName : the class name to apply when active
 --> activeStyle : the style to apply when active
 --> onClick(e) : a click event handler
 --> onlyActiveOnIndex : if set to true, Link will only be active when on exact index (and not when in any of its children)



# browserHistory and hashHistory

'browserHistory' uses History API (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History) to manipulate the URL. It requires additional server configuration to make it be able to handle URLs other than '/' such as '/home/accounts'.

```js
import { Router, browserHistory } from 'react-router';
```
```jsx
<Router history={browserHistory}>
```
```js
browserHistory.push('/some/path'); // will change the URL to '/some/path'
```

'hashHistory' uses URL hashes (example.com/#/some/path) and query keys (?_k=ckuvup). It requires no additional server configuration.

```js
import { useRouterHistory } from 'react-router'
import { createHashHistory } from 'history'
```
```js
const appHistory = useRouterHistory(createHashHistory)({ queryKey: false });
```
```jsx
<Router history={appHistory}>
```
```js
this.props.history.push('/some/path', { some: 'state' }); // will change the URL to '/some/path'
```

Note: 'browserHistory' is preferred over 'hashHistory'.
