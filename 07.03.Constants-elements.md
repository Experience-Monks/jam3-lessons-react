# Avoid unnecessary element reconciling

Every change on a component's parent component will trigger a new call for `React.createElement` and also a new reconciling step, which makes no sense if we know that our component or part of it will always remain constant.

To mitigate this, declare it as a constant on its parent.

```jsx
const icon = <Icon/>;

class SearchButton extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);

    this.state = {
      disabled: false
    };
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <button disabled={ this.state.disabled }>
        { icon } Search
      </button>
    );
  }
}
```

You can get similar behaviors by returning false when the component should update or extending from PureComponent class as mentioned before, something that might not be possible the source of the component doesnâ€™t belong to your project.
