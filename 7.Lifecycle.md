# Lifecycle

> Each component has several "lifecycle methods" that you can override to run code at particular times in the process.
Methods prefixed with will are called right before something happens, and methods prefixed with did are called right after something happens.

We could ask a React component to do certain things at certain stage of the lifecycle:

```JSX
class Welcome extends React.Component {
  // ...
  componentDidMount() {
    this.timer = setInterval(...);
  }

  componentWillUnmount() {
    clearInterval(this.timer);
  }
}
```

There are a bunch other lifecycle hooks, please refer to the References below to checkout more.
