# Rendering an Element into the DOM

In order to mount a element to DOM, firstly we need an empty tag in our document:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <title>React Lessons</title>
</head>
<body>
  <div id="root"></div>
</body>
</html>
```

Now we call `ReactDOM.render` and pass an element or a component and the DOM node we will for mounting it:

```jsx
const element = <h1>Hello world</h1>;

ReactDOM.render(
  element,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

Everything inside this element will be managed by React DOM.

React compares the DOM with the updated elements and only applies the DOM updates with the necessary changes.
This is what makes React really fast.
